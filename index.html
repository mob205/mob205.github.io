            <p>Hi! This is just a place for me to host the projects I've worked on. These are made mainly just for fun and are more like demos than they are fully fleshed out games.</p>

            <a href="circlegame/circlegame.html"><h1>Circle Game</h1></a>
            <p class="date">Started 8/5/18</p>
            <p>This game was my first real attempt at trying to make something myself. It's buggy and not very well designed, but I was proud to have made something at all.
            I learned a lot from this project and would like to think that things only got better from here.</p>
            <p>The objective of the game is to clear 2 rooms of enemies to reach the end. Left click to shoot and move with WASD.</p>

            <a href="battleofbunkerhill/index.html"><h1>Battle of Bunker Hill</h1></a>
            <p class="date">Started 10/20/18</p>
            <p>I was inspired to make this one after an assignment in my 8th grade history class. I think we had to design an arcade game that represented some part of what we learned in that unit, which the Battle of Bunker Hill was a part of. 
            I thought, instead of just designing it, why not actually make it? I have made a few improvements to this game years after I stopped working on it, 
            namely replacing the tragically bad shooting system I had and adding some sounds so it didn't feel so lifeless.</p>
            <p>This one is pretty simple: shoot the invading redcoats. If you run out of ammo or let too many enemies escape, it's game over.</p>

            <a href="fpstest/index.html"><h1>FPS Test</h1></a>
            <p class="date">Started 12/23/18</p>
            <p>After making Bunker Hill, I had the revolutionary idea of a game where you could shoot <em>and</em> move. Crazy stuff. I wanted to make multiple levels and all sorts of enemy types but I found that map building and 
            AI programming is hard. It kind of just became a test project where the main focus was the first person control and the gun mechanics. It was also a good opportunity to teach myself some 3D modelling as I wanted to
            make every asset myself. There are only 3 guns in the game right now. I wanted to add more originally but I guess I got bored or something and I don't feel like going back now.</p>
            <p>It controls like a normal FPS. Left click to shoot, right click to aim, space to jump, shift to run, R to reload, and number keys to swap weapons.</p>
        </div>

            <h1>A Knight's Adventure</h1>
            <p class="date">Started 10/4/19</p>
            <p>Here is where I finally made the switch to 2D pixel art. I think it's a lot easier to make good pixel art than it is to make a good 3D model, but I'm pretty bad at both anyway. This game was inspired by 
            The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past. I've never played the game before, but I liked the artstyle and the game mechanics looked pretty simple. The main thing I wanted out of this project was to get used to
            working with Unity in 2D and get some pixel art practice.</p>
            <p>Move with WASD and attack with left click.</p>

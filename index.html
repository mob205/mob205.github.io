                I was inspired to make this one after an assignment in my 8th grade history class. I think we had to design an arcade game that represented some part of what we learned in that unit, which the Battle of Bunker Hill was a part of.
                This was one of the first games I've made, so it doesn't look great and it's pretty simplistic. 
            </p>
            <p>This one is pretty simple: shoot the invading redcoats. If you run out of ammo or let too many enemies escape, it's game over.</p>

            <p>
                After making Bunker Hill, I had the revolutionary idea of a game where you could shoot <em>and</em> move. Crazy stuff. This is no where near a full game, this was just me messing around with first person movement and
                gun mechanics. It was also a good chance to practice my 3D modelling skills. The end result is pretty clunky, but the process was fun.
            </p>
            <p>It controls like a normal FPS. Left click to shoot, right click to aim, space to jump, shift to run, R to reload, and number keys to swap weapons.</p>

                This is where things start getting a bit more interesting. I switched over to 2D pixel art since it's easier than 3D modelling. This game was inspired by
                The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past. The main thing I wanted out of this project was to get used to working with Unity in 2D and get some pixel art practice.

            <p>Move with WASD, attack with left click, interact with E, heal with X. Get out of the forest.</p>

            <p>The main focus for this game was the shop system and upgrades. It's not my favorite project overall, but it was still fun to design and implement the different upgrades and systems. </p>
            <p>Move with WASD, left click to shoot toward your cursor. Get to the highest level you can.</p>

            <p>Hi! This is just a place for me to host the projects I've worked on and off of for the past few years. These are made mainly just for fun and are more like demos than they are fully fleshed out games. Just click on the title of the game to play it.</p>

                This game was my first real attempt at trying to make something myself. It's buggy and not very well designed, but I was proud to have made something at all.
                I learned a lot from this project and would like to think that things only got better from here.
            </p>
            <p>The objective of the game is to clear 2 rooms of enemies to reach the end. Left click to shoot and move with WASD. Good luck.</p>

                I was inspired to make this one after an assignment in my 8th grade history class. I think we had to design an arcade game that represented some part of what we learned in that unit, which the Battle of Bunker Hill was a part of.
                I thought, instead of just designing it, why not actually make it? I have made a few improvements to this game in recent times,
                namely replacing the tragically bad shooting system I had and adding some sounds so it didn't feel so lifeless.
            </p>
            <p>This one is pretty simple: shoot the invading redcoats. If you run out of ammo or let too many enemies escape, it's game over.</p>

                After making Bunker Hill, I had the revolutionary idea of a game where you could shoot <em>and</em> move. Crazy stuff. This is no where near a full game, this was just me messing around with first person movement and
                gun mechanics. It was also a good chance to practice my 3D modelling skills. The end result is pretty clunky and uninteresting, but the process was fun.
            </p>
            <p>It controls like a normal FPS. Left click to shoot, right click to aim, space to jump, shift to run, R to reload, and number keys to swap weapons.</p>

                Here is where I finally made the switch to 2D pixel art. I think it's a lot easier to make good pixel art than it is to make a good 3D model. This game was inspired by
                The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past. The main thing I wanted out of this project was to get used to
                working with Unity in 2D and get some pixel art practice.
            </p>
            <p>Move with WASD, attack with left click, interact with E, heal with X.</p>
